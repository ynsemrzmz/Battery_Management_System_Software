Battery management system has 3 critical missions : Monitor , Balance and Protection. Our battery management system can monitor
22 cell voltages , and if in need it can balance them with passive balance method. It has over voltage protection , under voltage protection and 
temperature protection for electric car. It can measure the current which flows through our battery with shunt resistor. Also BMS has 4 temperature sensor
input , x2 RS232 output and buzzer output.
